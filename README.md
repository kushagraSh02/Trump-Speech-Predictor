# Trump-Speech-Predictor
Predicting the next 20 words of Donald Trump's Speech using his 2019 Election Speeches.

Here we use Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) RNN to try to predict the speech of Donald Trump's election speech.

We make a sequential architecture with some LSTM and Dense layers to make a model to try to accurately predict the speech of the then president of the united states of america.
